          <p>Mr. Iaconoâ€™s presence was a welcome plus, and we were quite starstruck, but the impression left by the pie would have spoken for itself sans his well wishes. The ingredients were simple and fresh, leaving little to complain about, perfect for a staple that has no pretension. I do wish, however, that the floury crust had some seasoning to it to liven up the experience of what essentially becomes eating bread at the end of each slice, albeit a texturally well executed piece of bread. While the price tag ($36) is significantly taxing on the wallet, it certainly lived up to the hype, and I look forward to going back for another pie.</p>
