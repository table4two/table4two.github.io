          alt="Margherita from Lucali">
          <p>A glance at Lucali’s signature margherita assumes simplicity-  a cracker-thin pie brushed with red sauce layered beneath heavy dollops of cheese accompanied by vibrant, fresh basil. The cheese itself exhibited a complexity in both its chewy bite and its depth of salty-savory flavor. While I love a generous portion of a good red sauce, this pie was sparing, bringing a gentle, bright sweetness that played well with other flavors. The dough was soft and thin enough for a slice to pour down my one-handed grip but a gentle caramelization brought the subtlest of “snaps” in each bite. The amalgam becomes a complexity of flavors and toppings that I have never experienced before in a margherita. I only wish that I could have gotten Mr. Iacono to sign the box.</p>
