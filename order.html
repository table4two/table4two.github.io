          <p>The crust was chewy as well as crispy, the combination of textures that define a good pizza and disappear within 10 of the pie leaving the oven. There were several kinds of cheese, at least some of which were mozzarella, some which covered the pie and stretched a great deal, others which were squeaky white globs of flavor, snapping in contrast to the base cheeseâ€™s pull. The sauce was light and when paired with the basil provided on the side came through as light and just a little sweet.</p>
