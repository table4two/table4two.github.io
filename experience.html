          <p>Daniel and I set out at 3:45, prepared to wait an hour to put our names down, and another hour or more to get our food. Yet when we arrived after 25 minutes of speed walking, the only sign that we were nearing the “Ugly Delicious” featured pizzeria was a pair of customers a block away holding a flat white box. A mere 15 minutes after ordering our pizza was handed to us, and as we turned to leave we saw Mark Iacono, who nodded, smiled, and said “enjoy it guys”.</p>
